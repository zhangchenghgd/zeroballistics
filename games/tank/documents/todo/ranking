don't re-commence a game that already is in progress..

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

startMatch console function with ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES only!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RankingRegisterMatch and RankingClientLogon look very similar
do suicide in ClientInterface?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

transmit scores, not accepted players to game server, which then
distributes stuff to players

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

need ranking concept!!!

-) put goals into score? bias team outcome with goals?
-) review glicko rating system

-) punishment: will affect single player only (for hosters); add points to other players?

-) how to account for team changes? average skill of team? average of lose / win / draw?
=> won't fit won/lost/draw stats data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

really have dedicated servers as players in ranking (when canceling matches, they get in)?
mark them, via user_level, exclude from php listings

punish hoster of canceled matches / canceled matches in general
punish players for canceling matches?
or: calc their percentage on winning team, losing team

need to have timeout on server in case something goes wrong on ranking
server and no reply is sent to match id registration, stats upload...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

debug class which prints out stats processor actions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

explicitly model TGS_BEFORE_MATCH_START
don't award points etc
-> startMatch, condition for it in all logic classes
reset team ball possesion and such on match start
check for other stuff which needs to be reset


go back to state TGS_BEFORE_MATCH_START if player leaves.
=> need to reset stats anyway

rewrite reloadlevel to handle this kind of stuff ( keep team assignments intact)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

require all player slots to be taken in order to start match?

handle spectators...

plausibility check time that match was in progress

send matchid to connecting clients
-> clients might be connected before match id is known -> send it with win message?
or send total stats with win msg?
issue detailed warning if match ID cannot be retrieved by game server!
match ID is sent to all connecting clients, together with all player
scores -> only game server has to communicate with ranking server

boost time into stats?

send player stats to players, distribute via game server?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

split RankingGameStats into two parts
-) data
-) communication

communication classes:
-) client logon
-) game server match start
-) game server match stats
-) client fetch match stats / player stats


separate ports on ranking server for gamestats / client requests?

even split server?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what to do about DNS lookups????

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

querying clients can block server gamestats transmission!
-) listen on separate port?
-) repeatedly try to deliver

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

session key issue on windows?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

torverh√§ltnis in stats?

bekommene tore in statistik

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fixed number of players in soccer game
2-2 / 1-1

cancel match if one player leaves?

team names into match table

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

weight elo update result with time on each team

weight elo k-factor based on time in game, count whole game if quitting



need to account for different team sizes in ranking calculation...
limit matches to equal player numbers?
use sum of ranks so uneven teams will be punished severely?


store number of matches, adjust K-factor


don't display rating before a certain number of games are played

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stats nice to have:

accuracy
shot distribution tank / ball
ram kills
avg/min/max time to live
distribution tractor beam / cannon

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    There are 4 players in a Gang of Four game. Let's name A the
winning player, B the second one, C the third one and D the last
one. We consider that there were 6 duels: A won against B, C and D. B
won against C and D. C won against D. We compute independently the new
scores for each duel, and then we average the values for each player.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

have hosting (server) stats, too
number of players per hour, day etc
need server identifiers, same as hosting player id? or do that by IP?

total players per hour/day etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

plausibility checks:

matching player session keys, server id

what to do on plausibility mismatch? drop whole log? no, 
drop player only
