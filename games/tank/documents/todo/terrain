don't require tex layers for export

new level class, load/save xml format
put into bbmloader dir
reuse ObjectGroupLoader, rename to level, add save functionality


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

remove horz_scale, vert_scale etc from params




check out grome osg exporter for texturing ideas
render multiple stages with same geometry like grome?



remove all terrain, level editing stuff from blender?
or keep it as backup solution?



implement bicubic interpolation for ray tests? this could severly
improve driving behaviour...


own terrain format to avoid using osg for terrain height data (dedicated server...)

store detail as vertex attrib? or store it in texture?
uses less memory when stored per vertex? no
if blending, uses less memory when in texture
but: additional texture accesses


ditch bufferobject class
use new OSG's vertex, index buffers



specify  terrain params from level desc file
(scale etc)
rename ObjectGroup to level
what to do about fog?
into level desc?
as well as ambient light?
how to integrate terrain fog  with rest? (dist, color to bg color...)
clear color to params, to level desc?
move fog code to scene, only get fog params from terrain




don't require lm, cm to be same size as hm



texturing:
one detailed, dynamically synthesized tex per clipmap level?
or even precreate whole texture, only upload?
