Gameplay issues/changes:

somehow limit shots? lesser influence on tank?
"charge" shots? uncharged shot with neglible effect on tank?

solve ram problem
no HP? ram kills when over given speed? frontal ram kills both?
or require "combo" - charged shot + ram?

ball no damage when colliding!


how can better ball control be achieved?

-) make ball smaller - guidable via splash effect, not direct hit
   use collision shape larger than ball itself so no direct hit is required

-) let claws have "direction", let ball pass through in one dir.


how many players? instant matchmaking instead of server browser?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

make number of ball particles velocity-dependend

slow down tanks too with laser

animated textures

stadium modular? 

own GuiHelp for soccer


let slowdown shoot continuously, own weapon

no collision damage at all except for ramming
