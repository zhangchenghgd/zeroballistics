I'd like to add here that the linux version of the game, after it has
detected that the graphics card doesn't support GLSL (intel
945. integrated :D ), gives this error and doesn't change the
resolution back to normal. I know it's not a big problem (the game
won't be playable anyway), but it would be nice to see this fixed.

FSAA x6 x8 did work with beta 1.0?
doesn't with 1.1?

During a team match this morning my teammate commented that his kill
points were not increasing. i checked and mine were the same. Stayed
at 2 until the end of the match. I had scored and used an upgrade
earlier in the game.

In the game it was the upgrade points that did not increase - sorry to
confuse you. As I said, it affected my team partner too.

It happened again yesterday - my opponent was affected, but not me (we
tested). Both times were on the map with the water (dmbridge?).

I do not know if other points / stats were affected.

MG direction bug???
test initialization with incorrect v
if other guy starts shooting, it goes away...??

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

defender beacon doesn't rotate anymore... why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

beacon health still goes up after being fired on (on client)
-> call stophealing on hit

re-test with 16 bit color depth - osg FrameBuffer doesn't work
either switch to 32 or make it work with 16

projectile flyby: culled when firing position is out of sound range?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jump capability depends on framerate -> correct this, put it into CSP

Warning : Received invalid beacon in GameLogicClientConqueror::beaconConnections -> crash
when connecting to a running game
are beacon connections sent during connection process?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


particle effect bugs:
-) LocalEffectOperator doesn't work correctly for newly created particles, especially at low framerates
   don't affect particle which was just created, as its position is correct...?

-) tracer direction is incorrect sometimes. VelocityScaleShooter broken?

this prevents mines below water from being destroyed

connection bug: no cleanup after loadLevel???



prevent ESC from being pressed while loading, or abort loading process?

return to game if level is loaded while in options menu...



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

do proper wheel + engine handling now?
add wheel mom. inertia, spindown&up time

make engine sound dependent on avg. driven wheel rotation speed
